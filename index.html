<h1>Past Projects</h1>
<h3>Microorganisms.</h3>
<p>Choanoflagellates are unicellular flagellate eukaryotes considered to be the closest living relatives of the animals. They have a funnel-shaped collar made of microvilli at the base of a flagellum. Movement of the flagellum creates currents that can propel through viscous fluids and trap surrounding food particles against the collar of microvilli, where they are engulfed. Choanoflagellates are of particular interest to evolutionary biologists studying the origins of multicellular animals, as they serve as a useful model for reconstructions of the last unicellular ancestor of animals.<br><br>

  Modeled microorganism structure and fluid dynamics using physical laws, regularization and numerical methods. Built a MATLAB program from scratch to simulate 3D interactions of microorganisms with particles in viscous fluid.</p>

<h3>Birds.</h3>
<p>
  
  Collaborated with two interns to research, collect and analyze data on the strength of association between male bird attractiveness and female bird investment from 31 empirical studies of 20 bird species. Built and improved regression model fit by 12% after incorporating bird phylogenetic tree in R, yielding support for differential allocation and that the degree of polygamy in bird species was an important contributor.</p>

<h3>Value at Risk.</h3>
<p>Studied value at risk (VaR) of a portfolio of stocks using historical simulation and model-building techniques on 15 years of daily stock price data from Yahoo! Finance covering the stressed period of the 2007 financial crisis.
Implemented and back-tested time weighted and volatility updating methods such as exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models using SAS.
Implemented using MATLAB and incorporated stable distributions in mean-conditional value at risk (M-CVaR) optimization to analyze the effects of heavy-tailed market data distribution’s higher moments, yielding 15% smaller risk in the recommended portfolio allocation when compared to traditional mean-variance optimization.</p>

<h3>Antivirus.</h3>
<p>Created online surveys on SurveyMonkey to collect student responses on their usage of the antivirus software provided by the university.
Analyzed campus-wide responses with hypothesis testing, yielding the result that significant number of students preferred an alternative antivirus software.</p>

<h3>Fraud.</h3>
<p>Cleaned, visualized and analyzed class imbalance data from Université Libre de Bruxelles Machine Learning Group in Python.
Tested over-/under-sampling methods with standard/robust variable scaling in training logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting and neural network models.
Reduced feature dimension by analyzing feature importance and variance inflation factors.
Applied appropriate data processing pipeline to prevent data leakage.
Tuned models with grid search and evaluated models with learning curves, confusion matrix, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, precision-recall curves and k-fold cross validation.</p>

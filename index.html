<h3>Microorganism.</h3>
<p>Choanoflagellates are unicellular flagellate eukaryotes considered to be the closest living relatives of the animals. They have a funnel-shaped collar of interconnected microvilli at the base of a flagellum. Movement of the flagellum creates currents that can propel through viscous fluids and trap surrounding food particles against the collar of microvilli, where they are engulfed. Choanoflagellates are of particular interest to evolutionary biologists studying the origins of multicellularity in animals, as they serve as a useful model for reconstructions of the last unicellular ancestor of animals.<br>
  Modeled microorganism structure and fluid dynamics using physical laws, regularization and numerical methods. Built a MATLAB program from scratch to simulate 3D interactions of microorganisms with particles in viscous fluid.</p>
<h3>Bird.</h3>
<p>Collaborated with two interns to research, collect and analyze data on the strength of association between male bird attractiveness and female bird investment from 31 empirical studies of 20 bird species. Built and improved regression model fit by 12% after incorporating bird phylogenetic tree in R, yielding support for differential allocation and that the degree of polygamy in bird species was an important contributor.</p>
<h3>Value at Risk.</h3>

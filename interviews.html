<h2>Past Interview Experiences</h2>
<h4>(and what I have learned to improve)</h4><br>

<h3>2016 (Internships)</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><i>Discover</i> - The hiring manager was unsatisfied with my lack of knowledge of basic statistical modeling assumptions.</dt>
  <dd>- (In grad school, I decided to take more statistics courses to strengthen foundations and expand knowledge in statistical modeling.)</dd><br>
  
  <dt><i>Genworth</i> - The HR asked mainly behavioral questions and seemed to be concerned of my lack of experience in investing.</dt>
  <dd>- (Years later, I finally started investing on my own as it became trendy during Covid.)</dd><br>
  
  <dt><b>Lenovo</b> - I was invited to on-site interview where the hiring manager was very nice and was super impressed with my GPA, but he later ghosted.</dt>
</dl><br>

<h3>2017 (Full Time)</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><i>US Bank</i> - The HR initially contacted me when I had not yet graduated from my PhD program and thus I was not available to move forward in the process. Some time later, she called back and still showed interest in letting me proceed to the second round. The team member was very nice and was happy with my background and skills, which led to an offer. The senior manager and HR were super nice and generous when negotiating the offer.</dt><br>
  
  <dt><i>GEICO</i> - There was a take-home assignment and the hiring manager was content with my skills, but he chose someone who had neural network experience.</dt>
  <dd>- (Years later, I finally started learning neural network in preparation for data science transition.)</dd><br>
  
  <dt><i>BB&T</i> - The HR was not happy with my lack of questions to ask him.</dt>
  <dd>- (With enough interview and work experience, this skill came naturally.)</dd>
</dl><br>

<h3>2018</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><i>Disney</i> - The HR did not give credit to my internship experiences and was not able to offer salary range above $100k.</dt>
  <dd>- (Just have to have more years of work experience.)</dd><br>
  
  <dt><i>SAS</i> - The HR was super nice and professional. Phone technical interview with the hiring manager consisted CS focused questions since he was of CS background. He was not confident in my knowledge of CS but still decided to invite me on-site. The on-site interview involved multiple rounds with everyone on the team. They grilled me on the project I did on credit loan default and were unsatisfied with me not considering it as a class imbalance problem. The senior manager was of optimization background and gave a constrained uniform sampling problem where he was unsatisfied with my ability to solve the problem. The manager was not generous and complained they spent more on my flight to the on-site than other candidates.</dt>
  <dd>- (Later, I went through the constrained uniform sampling problem to ensure I was able to fully construct an answer. Years later, I thoroughly researched and did an entire fraud detection class imbalance problem exercise in preparation for data science transition.)</dd><br>
  
  <dt><i>Factual</i> - There was a coding challenge that involved JSON that I had never been exposed to before.</dt><br>
  
  <dt><i>Upstart</i> - There was an interview with a team member who seemed to be unsatisfied with my experience level.</dt><br>

  <dt><i>Western Asset</i> - The HR was distracted during the interview and ghosted.</dt><br>
</dl><br>

<h3>2019</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><i>Snowflake</i> - The hiring manager was unsatisfied with my lack of the ability to take on the role of the sole data scientist on the team.</dt><br>
  
  <dt><i>Credit Sesame</i> - The HR was new and lacked knowledge of the company.</dt><br>
  
  <dt><i>Playstation</i> - The hiring manager had a PhD background and was nice, but she ghosted maybe because she was unsatisfied with my ability to consider sampling and scaling problems.</dt><br>
  
  <dt><i>Insight Fellows</i> - The team member was unsatisfied with my skill set.</dt><br>
  
  <dt><i>Citi</i> - The algorithmic trading validation hiring manager was unsatisfied with my knowledge of trading but still gave an offer because they had candidates who ghosted them due to visa issues and they were in need of staff ASAP. The team members were really nice and were content with my abilities. The counterparty risk manager with physics background was very nice. He also asked me the constrained uniform sampling problem but did not connect with the answer I gave. Overall he was still content with me and made an offer. HR was very exploitative and refused to negotiate. She later came back begging to negotiate but I declined the offer.</dt><br>
  
  <dt><i>CIT</i> - When the HR reached out, I was already given two offers from Citi. So the HR quickly moved me forward in the interview process. The hiring manager, senior managers, and team members were all really nice. There was no technical interview and despite my lack of experience and knowledge in mortgage prepayment modeling, the hiring manager still showed interest and gave an offer. The HR was very nice and generous during the offer negotiation.</dt><br>
  
  <dt><i>Expedia</i> - There was a take-home assignment. The hiring manager was lackluster and seems to be unsatisfied with my ability to think from a product perspective.</dt><br>
  
  <dt><i>T-Mobile</i> - The HR was very unethical and forced me to give out names of those who are talented but not looking for a job. He was very racist and assumed I needed visa and had low salary expectations. The range he provided capped at $75k.</dt><br>

  <dt><i>Farmers Insurance</i> - The HR was very nice but reached out too late and I had already accepted offer from CIT.</dt><br>
  
  <dt><i>Navy Federal Credit Union</i> - The HR reached out too late and I had already accepted offer from CIT.</dt><br>
</dl><br>

<h3>2021</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><i>Mars</i> - The HR was very unprofessional and lacked knowledge of the company. The hiring manager was very humble and nice. He was content with my overall skill set but was concerned the job would be more business than machine learning and too boring for me.</dt><br>
  
  <dt><i>TikTok</i> - There was a take-home assignment about product but I did not impress manager enough to get interviewed.</dt><br>
  
  <dt><i>Amazon</i> - The team member with mathematics and statistics background was very nice and charismatic. He was content with my knowledge of mathematics and statistics but I had hiccups on the coding challenge. Still waiting to hear back.</dt><br>
  
  <dt><i>Farmers Insurance</i> - The HR was very professional and friendly. He needed to consult the manager to see if I would get interviewed for a mid-level position instead of junior-level.</dt><br>
  
  <dt><i>Paylocity</i> - The HR was concerned that I had no “real world” python coding ability and that I was California-based, which would imply a higher salary range.</dt>

<h2>Past Interview Experiences</h2>
<h4>(and what I have learned to improve)</h4><br>

<h3>2016 (Internships)</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b>Discover</b> - The hiring manager was unsatisfied with my lack of knowledge of basic statistical modeling assumptions.</dt>
  <dd>- (In grad school, I decided to take more statistics courses to strengthen foundations and expand knowledge in statistical modeling.)</dd><br>
  
  <dt><b>Genworth</b> - The HR asked mainly behavioral questions and seemed to be concerned of my lack of experience in investing.</dt>
  <dd>- (Years later, I finally started investing on my own as it became trendy during Covid.)</dd><br>
  
  <dt><b>Lenovo</b> - I was invited to on-site interview where the hiring manager was very nice and was super impressed with my GPA, but he later ghosted.</dt>
</dl>

<h3>2017 (Full Time)</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b>US Bank</b> - The HR initially contacted me when I had not yet graduated from my PhD program and thus I was not available to move forward in the process. Some time later, she called back and still showed interest in letting me proceed to the second round. The team member was very nice and was happy with my background and skills, which led to an offer. The senior manager and HR were super nice and generous when negotiating the offer.</dt><br>
  
  <dt><b>GEICO</b> - There was a take-home assignment and the hiring manager was content with my skills, but he chose someone who had neural network experience.</dt>
  <dd>- (Years later, I finally started learning neural network in preparation for data science transition.)</dd><br>
  
  <dt><b>BB&T</b> - The HR was not happy with my lack of questions to ask him.</dt>
  <dd>(With enough interview and work experience, this skill came naturally.)</dd>

<h3>Microorganisms.</h3>
<p>Choanoflagellates are unicellular flagellate eukaryotes considered to be the closest living relatives of the animals. They have a funnel-shaped collar made of microvilli at the base of a flagellum. Helical beating movement of the flagellum creates water currents that can propel itself through viscous fluids, trapping and engulfing surrounding food particles with the collar of microvilli. Choanoflagellates are of particular interest to evolutionary biologists, as these microorganisms serve as a useful model for reconstructions of the last unicellular ancestor of animals.<br><br>

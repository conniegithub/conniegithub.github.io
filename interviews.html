<h2>Past Interview Experiences</h2>
<h4>(and what I have learned to improve)</h4><br>

<h3>2016 (Internships).</h3>
<p>Discover - The hiring manager was unsatisfied with my lack of knowledge of basic statistical modeling assumptions.<br><br>
(In grad school, I decided to take more statistics courses to strengthen foundations and expand knowledge in statistical modeling.).<br><br><br>

Genworth - The HR asked mainly behavioral questions and seemed to be concerned of my lack of experience in investing.<br><br>
(Years later, I finally started investing on my own as it became trendy during Covid.)</p><br>

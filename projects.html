<h2>My Favorite Past Projects</h2>
<h4>(that shaped who I am today and continue to inspire who I will be tomorrow)</h4><br>

<h3>Microorganisms.</h3>
<p>Choanoflagellates are unicellular flagellate eukaryotes considered to be the closest living relatives of the animals. They have a funnel-shaped collar made of microvilli at the base of a flagellum. Helical beating movement of the flagellum creates water currents that can propel itself through viscous fluids, trapping and engulfing surrounding food particles with the collar of microvilli. Choanoflagellates are of particular interest to evolutionary biologists, as these microorganisms serve as a useful model for reconstructions of the last unicellular ancestor of animals.<br><br>

The goal was to construct a computer-generated 3D model that simulated the movement of choanoflagellates in viscous fluids. The body structure of a choanoflagellate was modeled using a discretized ellipsoidal head, a rotating helical-shaped flagellum, and vector lines of microvilli that followed Hooke’s law to capture its elasticity. Viscous fluid dynamics was modeled using Stokes equations with regularized Stokeslets and the surrounding particles followed the dynamics induced by the interaction of water and the entire body of the choanoflagellate.<br><br>

The entire simulation model was coded and built from scratch in MATLAB. Although heavy in using physics and numerical mathematics, this was the project that greatly expanded my ability to independently code up an entire program with the divide-and-conquer strategy. It also heightened my interest in programming.</p><br>

<h3>Birds.</h3>
<p>In the world of birds, males are more colorful or ornamented physically than females in most species. Female birds typically select their mates based on the overall attractiveness of the male birds.<br><br>

The goal was to find out if the amount of investment a female bird would put into her egg depended on the attractiveness of her mate (differential allocation) and the degree of polygamy. Effect size data from 31 different empirical studies of 20 bird species was collected. Given that related species were more closely associated with each other, a phylogenetic tree of bird species was employed in a Generalized Least Squares Model to account for the correlated structure. Predictors of the model included experiment type, degree of polygamy, features that indicated egg investment (i.e. androgens, egg size, yolk mass, etc.), and interaction terms.<br><br>

The regression model was coded and built in R. The model fit was improved by 12% after incorporating the bird phylogenetic tree. It yielded support for differential allocation and that the degree of polygamy in bird species was an important contributor. This project shifted my focus from mathematical modeling in biology to statistical modeling in biology, increasing my interest in statistical applications in the real world.</p><br>

<h3>Risk.</h3>
<p>Investments involve taking on a lot of risk. One measure to estimate the risk of loss is the value of risk (VaR).  With a given probability, it estimates how much money a portfolio might lose in a set time period.<br><br>

The goal was to gauge the VaR of a portfolio of stocks during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. 15 years of daily stock price data was collected to cover the periods before, during, and after the stressed period of the crisis. Historical simulation and model-building techniques were implemented with time weighted and volatility updating methods such as exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH). Later, stable distributions were incorporated in the mean-conditional value at risk (M-CVaR) optimization to analyze the effects of heavy-tailed market data distribution’s higher moments, which yielded 15% lower risk in the recommended portfolio allocation when compared to the traditional mean-variance optimization.<br><br>

The simulations and models were coded and built from scratch in R. This project introduced mathematical applications in finance to me, shifting my focus from bio-mathematics to financial mathematics.</p><br>

<h3>Fraud.</h3>
<p>Credit card fraud poses a big problem in the financial industry. Millions of dollars in losses resulting from financial fraud have occurred in the recent years.<br><br>

The goal was to correctly classify fraudulent credit card activity when a transaction occurred. Credit card fraud data from the Université Libre de Bruxelles Machine Learning Group was taken for a closer examination. Data exploration showed that the data exhibits class imbalance, where there were more data points that are non-fraudulent than fraudulent. This could lead to inaccurate model predictions when the data was left untreated, making detection of a fraud difficult. Over-sampling and under-sampling methods with standard and robust variable scaling were tested in training basic machine learning models such as logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting and neural network. Appropriate data processing pipeline was applied to prevent data leakage, which could make model predictions overly optimistic. Feature dimension was later reduced by analyzing feature importance and variance inflation factors. Models were then optimized and tuned with grid search. Learning curves, the confusion matrix, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, precision-recall curves, and k-fold cross validation helped to evaluate models.<br><br>

The data exploration and training of models were coded in Python. This project helped me to get hands-on experience to a data science problem in the financial industry, dealing with imperfect data and applying machine learning techniques.</p><br><br>
